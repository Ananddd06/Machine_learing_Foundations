# Machine Learning Algorithms Overview

Machine learning (ML) algorithms are the backbone of data-driven predictive models.

## Conclusion

The best algorithm for your model will depend on:
- **The type of problem**: Is it classification, regression, clustering, or something else?
- **The size and complexity of your data**: Do you have a small dataset, or are you dealing with high-dimensional data?
- **The trade-offs between accuracy, interpretability, and computational resources**: Some algorithms are more interpretable but less accurate, while others can achieve high accuracy but may require more computational resources.

By experimenting with different algorithms and analyzing their performance, you’ll be able to select the most suitable one for your problem.
